    <h1>An Animated Data Visualization</h1>
    <p><a href="https://www.infino.me/mortality/usmap">Click here</a></p>
    <p>This is a link to a visualization about mortality in the U.S.<br>
    The hover effect can be done simply by using :hover in CSS. <br>
    However, :hover has limits on it's own. Thankfully, d3 can also <br>
    accomplish the same effects on it's own.</p>
    <p class="javascript">.on("mouseover", function(){</p>
      <p class="javascript">d3.select(this)</p>
        <p class="javascript">.attr("fill","gray");</p>
    <p class="javascript">});</p>
    <p>When the mouse moves over a rect, the event listener for <br>
    that rect is triggered, the rect is selected as this, and <br>
    then the fill is set to gray. All of this is done without <br>
    CSS.</p>
